    hen the Renault–Nissan Alliance was formed in 1999, Nissan new COO Carlos
    Ghosn instructed the company to transform is product portfolio in Europe.
    The C-segment Almera, a slow-seller in Europe became a primary focus. In
    early 2002, 25 European Nissan engineers travelled to the brand’s technical
    centre in Japan to start of a 12-month project to develop the successor of
    the Almera. It was projected to be larger, to compete with the SEAT Altea
    and Volkswagen Golf Plus. In December 2002, the company concluded the
    planned model would not be as profitable and competitive as was required.
    The development team eventually came up with the idea of a "mini-Murano"
    type of vehicle smaller than the X-Trail that would be positioned to compete
    with hatchback and saloons. The development was focused on creating a
    European-oriented vehicle with the desirability, practicality and
    versatility of an SUV but with the size, driving dynamics and running costs
    of a family hatchback. While engineering work was done by Nissan's European
    Technical Centre (NTCE), a design proposal was put forward by Nissan Design
    Europe (NDE), which created the 2004 Qashqai concept. During final
    development, Nissan decided the Qashqai would serve as a replacement for
    both the Almera in the C-segment and Primera in the D-segment. Nissan
    selected Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK as its manufacturing plant for the
    European market.[4]
