      Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛɐ̯ˈtseːdəsˌbɛnts, -dɛs-]
      (listen)),[6][7] commonly referred to as Mercedes and sometimes as Benz,
      is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in
      1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a Mercedes-Benz Group subsidiary established in
      2019) is headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.[1]
      Mercedes-Benz AG produces consumer luxury vehicles and commercial vehicles
      badged as Mercedes-Benz. From November 2019 onwards, Mercedes-Benz-badged
      heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) are managed by Daimler Truck,
      a former part of the Mercedes-Benz Group turned into an independent
      company in late 2021. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz was the largest brand of
      premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.[8]
      The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes
      and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely regarded as
      the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. The
      slogan for the brand is "the best or nothing".[9]
